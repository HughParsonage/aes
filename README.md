# Australian Election Study R Package

## About this package

This package contains the datasets of the [Australian Election Study](http://www.australianelectionstudy.org/index.html).

The SAS files have been converted using the [Haven package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/haven/index.html) to compressed R `rda` objects. The column labels have been preserved and factors have been labelled. The code to download and convert the raw files can be seen in the `data-raw` folder.

Help files for the dataset contain a data overview and codebooks for the 1987, 2013 and 2016 files. I'll convert the other files if I get around to it. I've probably made mistakes in bringing the codebooks across to R documentation format, so feel free to send a pull request to fix typos etc.
