Description: The AES routinely collects data among a nationally representative
    sample of voters. All of the AES studies are national, post-election self-
    completion surveys with the sample drawn randomly from the electoral register.
    Since 2010 the surveys have also included an online completion option. This
    package contains the responses to these surveys converted to Rdata format with
    the codebooks as inline documentation.
